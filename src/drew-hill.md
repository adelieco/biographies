Drew Hill is a full-stack software developer for Farm Credit Mid-America. He currently lives in Louisville, KY. Drew is 22 years old and loves to play video games with friends in his spare time. Fun fact! I have a bald spot on the top of my head. Before I was born, I had to have a monitor screwed into my head to keep track of my vitals. My current goal as a developer is to get better at design as a whole and use my knowledge to write successful SaaS's.
