Irma here, I recently moved to Indy from hot ole Miami, FL. It's been a pretty big change and still getting used to the new environments and especially getting comfortable with remote work. I love coffee, furry lil animals, traveling and videography. Fun fact, I make tech videos on the Youtubes. I've been learning web develpment for about a year now on and off, currently on JS. My goal is to learn the MEAN stack and build up a portfolio that I can showcase to future employers! I work in Web Testing and would really like to get my hands in scripting test cases or automation.
